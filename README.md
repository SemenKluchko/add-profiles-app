Here some react app about adding on a page github profiles, by typing username which u want to add.
In a project I use react props, function and class components, actually mostly class, just for understanding how it works.
Also it's works like using github api, with fetch method and async await.
Hosting on google firebase.
U can try and see my prcjt by follow this link - https://github-add-profiles-react-app.web.app/
